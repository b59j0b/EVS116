Laboratory   Practical 6: Synthesis of gold   nanoparticles
BackgroundColloidal   gold   is   a   suspension   of   submicrometre-size   particles   of   gold   in   a   fluid,   usually   water.   The   liquid   is   usually   either   an   intense   red   colour   (for   particles   less than   100   nm) or   blue/purple   (for   larger   particles).Due to the unique optical, electronic, and molecular-recognition   properties of gold nanoparticles, they are the subject of substantial   research,   with   applications   in   a   wide   variety   of   areas,   including   electron   microscopy, electronics,   nanotechnology, and   materials science.Colloidal gold has been used since ancient times:      the synthesis      of   colloidal gold was crucial to the 4th-century      Lycurgus      Cup,      which   changes   colour   depending on the   direction of the   light.   Later   it was   used   as a   method of   staining   glass.
   Solutions of gold   nanoparticles of   various sizes. The size   difference         causes the difference   in colours.Generally,    gold    nanoparticles      are      produced      in      a      liquid      ("liquid      chemical      methods")       by      reduction    of   chloroauric   acid   (H[AuCl4]).    After   dissolving   H[AuCl4], the   solution   is   rapidly   stirred while   a   reducing   agent   is   added.   This   causes   Au3+       ions   to   be   reduced   to   neutral   gold   atoms.       As   more   and   more   of   these   gold   atoms   form, the   solution   becomes   supersaturated,   and   gold   gradually   starts to   precipitate   in the   form   of   sub-nanometer   particles.   The   rest   of   the   gold   atoms   that   form   stick   to   the   existing   particles,   and,   if   the   solution   is stirred vigorously enough, the   particles will   be fairly   uniform   in   size.

Procedure for Synthesis and Characterisation of Gold NanoparticlesSome   metal   nanoparticles   may   be   synthesised   by   heating   a   suitable   metal   salt   solution   with   citrate.   This   method   uses the citrate   reduction to form. the   nanoparticles,   and   the   excess   citrate   helps   to   stabilise the   gold    nanoparticles   as    a   dispersion.   The    particles    are    therefore    not   “dissolved”    but    are    suspended    or   dispersed   in the   liquid   phase of the   media.The   formation   of   gold   nanoparticles   can   be   observed   by   a   change   in   colour,   since   small   nanoparticles   of   gold   are   red.   If   the   citrate   is   in   excess   in   the   reaction   mixture,   a   layer   of   absorbed   citrate   anions   on   the   surface   of   the   nanoparticles   will   give   them   a   net   negative   surface   charge.   The   charge   repulsion   of   the   particles   (like   charges   repel)   will   help   to   keep   the   nanoparticles   separate   and   therefore   dispersed.   The   presence of this colloidal suspension can   be   detected   by the   reflection   of   a   laser   beam   from   the   particles.
Objectives.
Your task   is to:
1. To synthesise gold   nanoparticles   using the citrate   reduction   method and   observe   the   presence   of   particles with a   laser   pen.
2. To characterise the   major absorption   peaks with the   observed   colour   of the   resulting   dispersion.
ExperimentColloid   chemistry,   and   any   experiments   working   with   trace    metals    requires   that    all   glassware    is    acid-   washed,   and   triple   rinsed   in   deionised   ultrapure   water   (not   distilled   water,   the   latter   is   not   ion-clean).   Reliable   results depend on a   high   level of cleanliness.    All the   glassware   has   been   cleaned   for   you.
Prepare   a   dilution   series   of   the   1   mM   HAuCl4      stock   solution   by   carefully   pipetting   each   of   the   following   into   conical flasks to form   20   mL solutions:

Using   the   hot   plate   provided;   heat   the   flasks   one   at   a   time,   with   a   magnetic   stirrer   bar   so   the   solution   is   continuously   mixed,   until the solution   is just   about   boiling.
[Safety:   Do   not touch the hotplate surface! Wear   Eye Shields]When   the   solution   is   just   at   boiling   point   (not   before),   add   2   ml   of   1%  代 写EVS116 From Molecules to Materials: Deconstructing the environment  2020/2021Java
代做程序编程语言 trisodium   citrate   solution   to   the   conical   flasks.   The   best   technique   is   to   make   sure   the   gold   solution   is   just   boiling   as   you   add   the   citrate   solution,   so   add the   citrate   solution fast.    The gold   nanoparticles   will   form   in   the   solution   gradually   as the   citrate   reduces the gold   (III).
Allow this gold solution to   cool.
Repeat the   procedure with the all the   remaining gold solutions,   including the   control.      When   each   solution   is cool,   remove each stirrer   bar   with the   aid   of   a   magnet   or forceps.
Question   (i):   Ultra-pure   water   was   used   for   the preparation   of the solutions   used in   the synthesis.   Why do   you   think   we have done   this?Question   (ii):   Do   you   think   that   the   type   of   surface   charge   will   alter   the   dispersivity   of the   nanoparticles?   What   do   you   think    would   happen    to    the   dispersion   if   there   is   no   net   charge    (neutral)   on   the   particle   surface?
For   use   in the   research   laboratory, one would   normally then dialyse the   particle   dispersions   in   ultrapure   water to   remove excess   reagents and to clean   up the   particles.   However,   for   our   purposes   we   can proceed with some simple spectrophotometry to characterise the   samples.
The absorption spectra of nanoparticle dispersions.It   is   possible   to   deduce   information   about   the   relative   particle   sizes   in   each   of   your   dispersions   using   some   simple   absorption   spectrophotometry.   If   a visible   spectrum   of the   dispersion   is   obtained,   and   different-sized   gold   nanoparticles give slightly   different   colours, then the   absorption   peak should   also   be   slightly   different   in   each of your dispersions.The   measurements   will   be   carried   out   using   a   UV/Vis   Spectrometer.       Full   instructions   for   the   operation   of   the   spectrophotometer   are   in   the   laboratory,   and   staff   are   there   to   help   you   set   up.   Use   3   ml   cuvettes,   but   keep your solutions.
•                            Obtain    the    visible    spectra    of    your    dispersions   from      700 to   400    nm.    Use    ultra    pure    water    as    the   reference   (blank).   Print   out the   spectra,   or   use   the   data   from   the   instrument   to   plot   the   spectra   for   each of your dispersions.
•                            Indicate    on   your    graphs    the   wavelength    range   where   the   transmittances   are   greatest   and   where   they are   least for each solution/dispersion.
•                            Obtain the wavelength corresponding to the   maxima   in absorbance.

   Question   (iii):    What   is    the    relationship   between   the   gold   concentration   in   the   original   solution   and   the   wavelength   where   the peak   emission occurs?   Do you   think   the particle size   distribution   is similar in   each   of   the prepared nanoparticle dispersions?
Question (iv):   Which one do you think has the particles of   the biggest   average size?
•                            From    the    visible    spectra,    choose    a   suitable   wavelength   to    measure   the   absorbance   of   the   3   gold   nanoparticle dispersions.
•                            Plot the   absorbance   against the   concentration   of gold   in   each   solution.
A plot of   A against C should   be   linear for a   solution   of absorbing   species.      In   this   case   the   absorbing   species   are   nanoparticles, so   it will be interesting to see whether the   plot is   linear or   not.
Question   (v):   What do you observe   from your graph?   What is   the significance of   your   observation   with   respect   to particle size or dispersion state? Do you think the Beer-Lambert Law still applies to particle dispersions?
Effect of NaCl   on   particle dispersions.
Adding a cation   (e.g.   Na+) to the dispersion   of gold   nanoparticles   may   screen the   negative   charge   on   the   particles, allowing them to approach   more closely   (agglomerate). This   results   in   a   colour   change   in the dispersion, which   reflects the change   in size of the   particles due   to   agglomeration.
•          Put   2   ml of   one   of your   nanoparticle   dispersions   into   each   of   four   test   tubes.
•          Keeping   the   first   tube   as   your   control   (nothing   added),   add   5-10   drops   of   0.1mM,   10mM   or    1    M   NaCl solution to the   next   3 tubes   one tube   (one   solution   per tube,   each   tube   a   different   solution).   Note the change of colour of the solution   as   the   nanoparticles   get   closer   together.
•          Measure   also the spectra   of your solutions with the different   amounts   of   NaCl   added.
Question (vi): How does the spectrum change with increasing NaCl   concentration?      What   does   this   tell   us   about   the dispersion?
At   the   end   of   the   class,   please   clean   up   your   bench,   but   DO   NOT   THROW   AWAY   your   gold   nanoparticle   (NP) solutions:    these will   be   retained for subsequent analysis.
